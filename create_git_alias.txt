git config --global alias.alias_name '!git add -A && git commit -m'

# Note that the command is enclosed in single quotes
# If chaining together multiple commands together, need to start with an "!" and use the "git" command (if a single command, "git" is assumed
# It doesn't appear that git will allow variables (so if trying to do "git checkout -b new-feature main" where new-feature was parameterized, we might need a shell function

# git config --global alias.new-feature = '!f() { git checkout -b $1 main; } f'
# though zsh is not liking this?


# To see a list of aliases configured:
# git config --get-regexp '^alias\.'
# *OR& git config --global --list (then just read through to find "alias."


# Current helpful aliases:
(list: List # of lines per file and project total)    git ls-files | xargs wc -l
(ac: add all and commit with the message passed)      git add -A && git commit -m
